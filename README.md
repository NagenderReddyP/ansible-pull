C-Reports
=========

A brief description of the project goes here.

Requirements
------------

Any pre-requisites that may not be covered by Ansible itself or the project should be mentioned here. For instance, if the project uses the EC2 module, it may be a good idea to mention in this section that the boto package is required.

Project Variables
--------------

A description of the settable variables for this project should go here, including any variables that are in defaults/main.yml, vars/main.yml, and any variables that can/should be set via parameters to the project. Any variables that are read from other projects and/or the global scope (ie. hostvars, group vars, etc.) should be mentioned here as well.

Dependencies
------------

A list of other projects hosted on Galaxy should go here, plus any details in regards to parameters that may need to be set for other projects, or variables that are used from other projects.

Example Playbook
----------------

Including an example of how to use your project (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

    - hosts: servers
      roles:
         - { role: username.rolename, x: 42 }

Author Information
------------------

An optional section for the project authors to include contact information, or a website (HTML is not allowed).
